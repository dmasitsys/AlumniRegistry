							<h2>What we do</h2>
							<p>Per Scholas.org, Per Scholas Alumni.org, Alumni, and future Graduates in partnership
								 with the Stakeholders launched The Per Scholas Alumni Registry, which is designed
								  to be a unique ecosystem and members only platform for IT Professionals.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-gem"></span>
									<h3>About Us</h3>
									<p>The objective of this ground-breaking Cloud platform will revolutionize how IT Professionals promote
										 their brand, collaborate on projects, engage prospective employers, and mentor other Per Scholas
										  Learners and professionals pursuing the completion of their Information Technology
										   certification.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-lock"></span>
									<h3>Our Why</h3>
									<p>Our Why is to harness the collective minds, financial resources, and buying power of the Alumni
										 population to promote access to capital, while allowing our members to access discounted 
										 consumer prices.</p>
										 
										 <p>This will be accomplished by negotiating purchasing agreements on 
										 behalf of our members. Members will pay an annual subscription, generating a new source of private funding.
										  This approach will not only benefit individual members but also supports the broader goal
										   of enhancing the operating budget of Per Scholas.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>The Mission</h3>
									<p>The Mission is anchored to the commitment of members to pay-it-forward through membership dues. 
										The financial resources generated from the Dues collected, will be dedicated to enhancing the
										 operating budget of Per Scholas, making robust training resources more accessible to future
										  learners. Additionally, offering financial support to qualified candidates who meet
										   specific evaluation criteria, ensuring that the benefits of the Alumni Registry extends
										    beyond its members, reaching individuals who may otherwise face financial and other barriers to entry
											 into the technology industry.</p>

											 <p>By establishing a cycle of support and investment, the mission demonstrates
												 a sustainable approach to community empowerment and industry advancement.
												  It aligns the interests of Alumni Registry members with the broader
												   goal of fostering growth and opportunity within the technology sector.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>The Vision</h3>
									<p>The Vision is focused on empowering IT professionals and supporting community
										 initiatives that create professionals who are Skilled Through Alternative Route (STAR).</p>

									<p>The Vision encompasses three key value principles:</p>
									<ul style="padding-left: 120px; margin-top: -40px;">
										<li>Funding</li>
										<li>Mentoring</li>
										<li>Training</li>
									</ul>
									<p>The emphasis on funding, mentoring, and training reflects a holistic approach to bridging
										 the gap between underserved communities and the technology industry.</p>

									<p>The financial contributions from Alumni members will provide a sustainable source of
										 funding, enabling the expansion of services and programs offered to the learning 
										 community. Alumni members participating as guest instructors will provide
										  valuable insight to those navigating the Information Technology (IT) career path.</p>

									<p>Overall, the vision must uphold the value of being well-rounded and impactful,
										 with a focus on both individual development and community empowerment.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-link"></span>
									<h3>The Project Concept</h3>
									<p>The project concept involved developing a Registry of IT Professionals who have graduated
										 from Per Scholas. Alumni and graduates will pay a subscription to have their profile
										  and portfolio promoted on the Registry.
										</p>
									<p>All Alumni, who are Members of the Registry, will donate a percentage of their income
										 (1% - 10%) to Per Scholas.org. A percentage (70% or more) of their donation will
										  be designated to the future funding of Per Scholas programs and initiative.
										   In addition, a percentage of the total donated funds (not exceeding 30%)
										    will be dedicated to the compensation budget of Per Scholas Employees and Instructors.
										</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>The Developers</h3>
									<p>The Developers, known as the VISIONARIES, a technology think tank, conceived and
										 developed the project to showcase how a National Per Scholas Alumni Registry could be
										  brought to life to benefit all Per Scholas Alumni, potential graduates, Stakeholders, 
										   Per Scholas.org, and Per Scholas Alumni.org.</p>
